WIRING DIAGRAM FOR VACCUUM AND MOTOR DRIVER

The VCC, R_EN, and L_EN pins on the MOTOR DRIVER are all attached to a 5V high line either on the arduino or on a breadboard.

The GND line is grounded, duh.

The RPWM pin on the MOTOR DRIVER is attached to digital (pwm) pin 5 on the ARDUINO.

The LPWM pin on the MOTOR DRIVER is attached to digital (pwm) pin 6 on the ARDUINO.

NOTHING NEEDS TO BE ATTACHED ON THE PINS LABELED R_IS OR L_IS ON THE MOTOR DRIVER.


IN ORDER TO ATTACH THE MOTOR AND POWER SOURCE TO THAT GREEN THING ON ONE SIDE OF THE DRIVER...BE CAREFUL TO READ THE BOTTOM OF THE BOARD IN ORDER TO GET THE POLARITY RIGHT, BUT STARTING FROM THE SLOT CLOSEST TO THE CAPACITOR AND GOING AWAY FROM THE CAPACITOR, THE ORDERING IS AS SUCH:

(CAPACITOR)--> B- --> B+ --> M+ --> M- 

!!!!!!!!!!!DONT MESS THIS UP OR SPARKS WILL FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B- IS WIRED TO THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF A 12V LIPO BATTERY

B+ IS WIRED TO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF A 12V LIPO BATTERY

M+ IS WIRED TO ONE NODE OF THE VACCUUM PUMP (it doesn't really matter, it it starts blowing just switch the node)

M- IS WIRED TO THE OTHER NODE OF THE VACCUUM PUMP (ditto)
