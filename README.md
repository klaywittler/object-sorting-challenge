# object-sorting-challenge
MEEN 612 Class Project

A project inspired by the Amazon Robotics challenge. Each team was tasked with developing a robot, hardware, and software to complete the task of moving targets from a disorganized box into sorting boxes that match target color or shape. Robot Operating System (ROS) was used to communicate between computer home base and a microprocessor on the robot. Using a computer vision algorithm, error coordinates were sent wirelessly from the home base to the RPP robot to actuate accordingly. A PID controller was used so that the robot could track effectively to the desired object.
