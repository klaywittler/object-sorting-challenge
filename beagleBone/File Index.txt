>> project2_controller
	Package that contains all controller files. Compiles and runs in ROS on the beaglebone. Files like "CMakeLists" and "package.xml" are required setup files that define the ROS node properties.

>> project2_controller/src/project2_controller

	Main c++ code for the program. Includes the logic, subscriber, PWM and digital outputs.

>> project2_controller/src/pwm.cpp

	Custom c++ code that makes using pwm output easier. Defines functions like "enablePWM(pinNumber)"

>> project2_controller/src/digitalIO.cpp

	Custom c++ code that makes using digital input/output easier. Example: "digitalWrite(pinNumber, value)"

>> project2_controller/src/BBB_GPIO.h

	C++ header file used to declare functions from pwm.cpp and digitalIO.cpp

===============================================================

>> BB-PWM-ALL-00A0.dtbo

	Custom device tree file that enables three PWM outputs on the beaglebone black.

>> enablePWMpins

	Executable script that loads "BB-PWM-ALL-00A0.dtbo" to the beaglebone black.
